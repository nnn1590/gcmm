GameCube/Wii Memory Manager is an aplication to backup Nintendo GameCube savegames.

Gcmm is a project started by dsbomb and justb, which is based on Askot's modification to add SD support to the mcbackup libogc example.

I (suloku) have updated the code to newest libraries to port it to the Wii system, and what I find more important: restoring savegames now works properly.

        Raw Images
--------------------------

A raw image is a 1:1 copy of the memory card. It can only be restored to the card it was made from.
Note that unofficial cards share the same Flash ID, which allows restoring raw images between unofficial cards (as long as they have the same size).

These limitations can be solved with Raw Tools: http://code.google.com/p/gcmm/wiki/Raw_Tools

For example:
You can grab a 59 block card raw image from an unofficial card and modify it so you can restore it to your 1019 blocks official card, mantaining the serial number of the card so your protected savegames still work.

note: as of GCMM 1.3 protected savegames can be restored to any card and they will work (thanks to Ralf!)


    Protected Savegames
--------------------------

This is just for information, as since GCMM 1.3 even serial protected savegames can be restored to any memory card.

There are two kinds of protected savegames:

* Permision protected savegames: this savegames can't be moved/copied from the Gamecube/Wii memory card manager. These saves can be backed up and restored without problems by GCMM

* Serial protected savegames: this savegames can't be moved/copied from the Gamecube/Wii memory card manager and will only work in the card they were backupped from. This protected savegames rely on the serial number that is given to the memory card when it is formated. That's why they won't work in other cards and why they won't work on the same card if that has been formatted.

Restoring a raw image to a diferent card won't work, it has to be the same card (it will work even if the card was formatted). Please note that all unofficial cards share the same Flash ID (which is different from the serial number), allowing raw image restoring between unofficial cards (as long as they are the same size).


    Other savegame formats
----------------------------
There are computer programs that can transform other savegame formats into GCI (currently GCMM supports SAV and GCS restoring).

RAW/GCP format is a raw image of the memory card with all its contents.

MCI format (createad by softdev's sdmc) is a raw image of the card, preceded by a 64 byte header.

Users:
* If you extract a device (USB, internal SD, USB gecko), it won't work againt. If you did so, reboot the GCMM. On the contrary
* Memory cards can be extracted/inserted at will at the main menu screen. It is not recommended to change the card in any other screen.
* Dolphin (wii/gc computer emulator) has a nice memory card manager, check it out!

About usb devices:
* Two of my usb devices won't work with GCMM, but those same devices make The Homebrew Channel crash. If you have problems try another usb device or an SD card.

Developers:

* LibOGC card functions works with time functions that use Epoch (seconds since jan 1, 1970) as reference, while GameCube works with seconds since jan 1, 2000). The difference is 946684800 seconds
* GCMM now uses libogc 1.8.11 git (2012-07-25) card.c, card.h and system.h with tueidj's patches for proper memory card unlocking. It would be wise to update those files in GCMM if changes are made to libogc concerning other functions. Note that even if libogc asumes the changes, as GCMM now uses some static functions from libogc, it needs card.c and card.h, but if libogc updates the sramex structure (system.h) and fixes the checksums in card.c, system.h will no longer be needed.
* Very good sources of documentation are libogc and dolphin's source code.
* Card_Init() shall be called only once. Any subsequent call will be pointless; to change the company and gamecode one should use Card_setgamecode() and Card_setcompany libogc functions.

Unzip the archive. You will find the following folders inside:

apps			Contains Homebrew Channel ready files
				(see Homebrew Channel instructions below)
				
gamecube		Contains GameCube DOL file (not required for Wii)
				

    Wii
----------
On the Wii, the savegames will be read from and written to the front SD slot or FAT32 USB device.
The user will be prompted at startup for which device to use.
If the selected device isn't available, GCMM will try to use the other device (i.e: user selects usb device but there's none connected, so GCMM will try to use the internal SD).
Memory card can be in either slot.


  Gamecube
------------
On the GameCube you will need a Gecko SD adapter in the slot A and place the memory card on slot B.

------------------------------
Loading / Running the app:
------------------------------

Wii - Via Homebrew Channel:
--------------------
The most popular method of running homebrew on the Wii is through the Homebrew Channel. If you already have the channel installed, just copy over the apps folder included in the archive into the root of your SD card.

If you haven't installed the Homebrew Channel yet, read about how to here:
http://hbc.hackmii.com/

Gamecube:
---------
You can load gcmm via sdload and an SD card in slot A, or by streaming 
it to your Gamecube, or by booting a bootable DVD with gcmm on it. 
This document doesn't cover how to do any of that. A good source for information on these topics is at http://www.gc-forever.com/wiki/index.php?title=Booting_Homebrew
